# MNemoLink

MNemoLink is a Flutter desktop application that interfaces with MNemo v2 cave surveying devices. It handles device communication, data transfer, processing, and export to various cave surveying formats.

## Features

- **Device Communication**: Connect to MNemo devices via USB serial or WiFi network
- **Data Processing**: Parse and validate DMP (Data Memory Package) files from MNemo devices
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export survey data to Excel (.xlsx), Survex (.svx), and Therion (.th) formats
- **Real-time CLI Interface**: Direct command-line interface for device control and data retrieval
- **Cross-platform Support**: Full functionality on Windows, Linux, and macOS; limited functionality on Android and iOS
- **Firmware Updates**: Manage MNemo device firmware updates directly from the application

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation between UI, business logic, and device communication:

### Core Components

- **models/** - Data models (Shot, Section, SectionList, SurveyQuality, Enums)
- **services/** - Business logic services for device communication, networking, data processing, file operations, and firmware updates
- **widgets/** - UI components including CLI interface, connection status, network panels, and data visualization

### Key Services

1. **DeviceCommunicationService** - Handles serial communication with MNemo devices
2. **NetworkService** - Manages network-based device discovery and data transfer
3. **DataProcessingService** - Processes raw survey data into structured sections
4. **FileService** - Handles DMP file operations and exports to Excel/Survex/Therion formats
5. **FirmwareUpdateService** - Manages firmware and software update operations

### Data Flow

1. Device connection via serial or network
2. Raw data transfer from MNemo device (DMP format)
3. Data processing into survey sections with shots
4. Export to various cave surveying formats
